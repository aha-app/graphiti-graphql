# graphiti-graphql

Automatically generate a GraphQL interface from your [Graphiti](https://www.graphiti.dev) resources. Supports queries (including polymorphic resources), filters, and CRUD mutations.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphiti-graphql'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install graphiti-graphql

## Usage

1. Include the gem in your Graphiti `ApplicationResource`.

```ruby
# app/resources/application_resource.rb
class ApplicationResource < Graphiti::Resource
  include Graphiti::GraphQL::Resource

  # ...
end
```

2. Add `graphql_entry` to any resources which should be available as a top-level queryable resource in GraphQL.

```ruby
# app/resources/post_resource.rb
class PostResource < ApplicationResource
  graphql_entry

  # ...
end
```

3. Run the [graphql-ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org/getting_started) generator and follow their setup. Once you've got a GraphQL controller, resolve queries through the autogenerated Graphiti schema instead of the default stub that graphql-ruby providers:

```ruby
# app/controllers/graphql_controller.rb
class GraphqlController < ActionController::Base
  def execute
    # ...

    # By default, graphql-ruby will generate you a schema:
    result = YourAppSchema.execute(query, variables: variables, context: context, operation_name: operation_name)

    # Replace it with:
    result = ApplicationResource.graphql_schema.execute(query, variables: variables)

    # ...
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
